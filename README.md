# WeatherAI
1. Ollama is required for this project to work. It can be installed here: https://ollama.com/download/windows
2. To run this project, enter "ollama pull mistral" in terminal, followed by "ollama serve"
3. If you cannot type ollama serve, enter task manager, and close all instances of ollama, before retyping ollama serve in terminal. In order to gain access to all NOAA data, this command is crucial.
4. Next, enter python ai_helper.py in terminal. 
5. You are now free to access the AI.
6. If you have any questions about my code, please feel free to contact me at kkapoor1@umbc.edu
