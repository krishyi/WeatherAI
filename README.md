# WeatherAI
1. Ollama is required for this project to work. It can be installed here: https://ollama.com/download/windows
2. To run this project, enter "ollama pull mistral" in terminal, followed by "ollama serve"
3. If you cannot type ollama serve, enter task manager, and close all instances of ollama, before retyping ollama serve in terminal. In order to gain access to all NOAA data, this command is crucial.
4. Next, enter python ai_helper.py in terminal. 
5. The responses may take some time, upwards of 1-3 minutes. To reduce this time, it is reccomended to close background programs/tasks to minimize memory usage. 
6. In case data after 2021 is not available, close terminal, reopen, and redo steps 2-4. This should fix the issue.
7. If you have any questions about my code, please feel free to contact me at kkapoor1@umbc.edu
