# WeatherAI
1. Ollama is required for this project to work. It can be installed here: https://ollama.com/download/windows
2. To run this project, enter "ollama pull mistral" in terminal, followed by "python ai_helper.py"
3. The responses may take some time, upwards of 1-3 minutes. To reduce this time, it is reccomended to close background programs/tasks to minimize memory usage. 
4. If there seems to be issues in the AI responses, cli.py can be used to test basic manual prompts, ensuring the NOAA data is accurate, before returning to ai_helper.py
